# AngularJS
### Factory, Provider ...

AngularJS is designed to follow MVC pattern in general(generally...).
If you have all logics in controller, it will be very complicated.<br/>
Important abstraction -> Factory<br/>
Using this and implementation -> Service <br/>
Use services in controller<br/>

In html DOM structure, more than one controller might be used. So, it is possible there are parent and child controller(s).
In this case, child and parent controllers can share declared functions.

```javascript
<div ng-controller="parentCtrl">
    <div ng-controller="childOneCtrl">
    </div>
    <div ng-controller="childTwoCtrl">
    </div>
</div>
```
