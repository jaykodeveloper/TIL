# Alembic
Alembic provides kinda version controlling on database. You can check your current status, merge different versions, and upgrade/downgrade.<br/>
Today I am going to try tutorial.<br/>
In order to be consistant, I created ubuntu docker image. 
This is my env setting.
```
- ubuntu20.04 docker image
- inside image, I installed python3, python3-dev, sqlite3
```
```
pip install alembic, sqlchemcy
```
Once your python environment has `alembic` installed, go to desired folder to start.
```
explain)
(alembic init {name of project} )

ex)
alembic init practice
```
It will create this folder structure
```
project(where you init alembic)
  |-alembic.ini
  |-practice
      |-README
      |-env.py
      |-script.py.mako
      |-version
          |-......py
          |-......py 
          ....
```
Inside of `alembic.ini`, there is `sqlalchemy.url=driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname`
I replaced it,
```
from
sqlalchemy.url=driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname
to
sqlalchemy.url=sqlite:///db_file.db
```
On the project folder start creating revisions.<br/>
Let's create first one
```
alembic revision -m "first example"
```
This will create the file in version folder that file name is hash, just like git.
```
"""first example

 Revision ID: 29cf196546aa
 Revises: 
 Create Date: 2021-06-20 03:58:06.808542
 
 """
 from alembic import op
 import sqlalchemy as sa
 
 
 # revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
 revision = '29cf196546aa'
 down_revision = None
 branch_labels = None
 depends_on = None
 
 
 def upgrade():
     """
     This is originally pass when it is created.
     I added code to create table
     """
     op.create_table(
            'customer',
             sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),
             sa.Column('firstname', sa.String(150), nullable=False),
             sa.Column('lastname', sa.String(150), nullable=False),
             sa.Column('recentvisit', sa.DateTime)
             )
 
 
 def downgrade():
     """
     This is also pass, but I added
     """
     op.drop_table('customer')
```
You can create more revisions as well. Once you have more than one revision, you can move your head to the most current one.
```
alembic upgrade head
```

There are many different commands that you can use to utilize your database safe.
```
alembic current -> check current status
alembic history -> see its history. add --verbose to see the detail
alembic heads -> show not merged ones
alembic merge ___ ___ ____ ... -> merge all revisions to make one
```
