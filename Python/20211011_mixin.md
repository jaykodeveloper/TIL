Mixin is a special sort of multiple inheritance method which only exists in multiple-inheritance languages.(다중상속)
For example,
```python
class Frist(object):
    def print_test(self):
        print "first"

class Second(object):
    def print_test(self):
        print "second"
        
class Body(BaseClass, First, Second):
    pass
```
In this example, the more right class is the higher class. Since **first** is located lefter, **obj=Body(); obj.print_test()** will print out **first** and it overwrites other class.

## Compare with Composision

### Mixin
- A small class that has to require **additional** method only
- Do not define instance attributes.
- Do not require **__init__**
- Multiple Inheritance.

### Composiion
- It **INCLUDES**
- When you want to use other class's function, but do not want full inheritance, you can do Composition

### Difference
- mixin: B is A -> IS,
- composition: B has A -> HAS
